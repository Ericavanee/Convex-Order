# Convex order via Wasserstein distance

This repository contains the implementations of the numerical examples in the paper "A new characterisation of convex order through the 2-Wasserstein distance", which can be found under arXiv:2207.01235.

## Prerequisites

Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, OT. The programs were tested with Python 3.7.0.

## Running the programs

Running the jupyter notebook plots the figures. The python files are used for the implementation of the optimization procedure. An interactive version of 'Main.ipynb' can be run here: https://colab.research.google.com/github/johanneswiesel/Convex-Order/blob/main/Main.ipynb.
