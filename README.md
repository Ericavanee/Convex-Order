# Convex order via Wasserstein distance

This repository contains the implementations of the numerical examples in the paper "A new characterisation of convex order through the 2-Wasserstein distance", which can be found under arXiv:2207.01235. Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01235

## Prerequisites

Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, OT. The programs were tested with Python 3.7.0.
For Bayesian Optimization package 'bayesian," hyperopt is also required. 

## Running the programs

Running the jupyter notebook plots the figures. The python files are used for the implementation of the optimization procedure. We provide two methods of optimization: 'Optimization' implements statistical sampling, while 'bayesian' implements bayesian optimization. An interactive version of 'Main.ipynb' can be run here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bH8hJwxKaWZPQTPJ8RJzQBcgerl0de8P?usp=sharing.
