# Convex order via Wasserstein distance

This repository contains the implementations of the numerical examples in the paper "A new characterisation of convex order through the 2-Wasserstein distance", which can be found under arXiv:....

## Prerequisites

Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, OT. The programs were tested with Python 3.7.0.

## Running the programs

Running the jupyter notebook plots the figures. The python files are used for the implementation of the optimization procedure.
